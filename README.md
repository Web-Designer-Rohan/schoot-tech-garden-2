# 🧰 Software Installer Toolkit

This toolkit automatically installs all `.exe` and `.msi` files from the `installers` folder using PowerShell.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Add your `.exe` or `.msi` installer files inside the `installers/` folder.
3. Right-click on `install.ps1` and select **Run with PowerShell**.
4. Sit back and let the script do the work!

## 📝 Notes

- Works silently with most installers using `/quiet /norestart` flags.
- Add/remove apps by simply managing files in the `installers/` folder.
